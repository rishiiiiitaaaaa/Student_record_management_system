# Student Record Management System 📚

Welcome to the Student Record Management System! This program allows users to manage student records, including adding new students, viewing student information, and adding marks for courses.

## Features ✨

- Add New Student: Add a new student with registration number, name, and proctor ID.
- Student Login: Students can log in using their registration number to view their marks.
- Add Marks: Admin can add marks for the courses (CSE1001, CSE1002) for students.
- View All Students: View the list of all students with their details and marks.

## How to Use 📝

### 1. Add New Student 
   - This option allows the user to enter the registration number, name, and proctor ID for a new student.
   - Initially, the marks for the courses (CSE1001, CSE1002) are set to 0.

### 2. Student Login
   - Students can log in by providing their registration number.
   - If the registration number matches an existing student, their name and marks for CSE1001 and CSE1002 will be displayed.

### 3. Add Marks  
   - This option allows the admin to input marks for the courses CSE1001 and CSE1002 for a specific student based on their registration number.

### 4. View All Students
   - Displays a list of all students, showing their registration number, name, and marks for the courses CSE1001 and CSE1002.

### 5. Exit

## Tech Stack 💻

- C++: The main programming language used to implement the system.

## Code Explanation 🔍

- Structures: The `Student` structure is used to store information about students, including registration number, name, proctor ID, and marks for two courses.
  
- Functions:
    - `addNewStudents()`: Adds a new student to the system.
    - `studentLogin()`: Allows students to log in and view their details.
    - `addMarks()`: Allows adding marks for students for the courses CSE1001 and CSE1002.
    - `viewAllStudents()`: Displays all students' information.
  
- Main Loop: A while loop is used to display a menu and process the user's choice.

## Example Usage 📄

Menu:  
```
1. Add New Student  
2. Student Login  
3. Add Marks  
4. View All Students  
5. Exit
```

Example:

1. Choose option 1 to add a new student:
   ```
   Enter the registration number: 12345
   Enter the name: John Doe
   Enter the proctor ID: Proctor01
   ```

2. Choose option 2 to log in as a student:
   ```
   Enter the registration number: 12345
   Name: John Doe
   CSE1001 marks: 0
   CSE1002 marks: 0
   ```

3. Choose option 3 to add marks for a student:
   ```
   Enter the registration number: 12345
   Enter CSE1001 marks: 85
   Enter CSE1002 marks: 90
   ```

4. Choose option 4 to view all students:
   ```
   Reg No: 12345, Name: John Doe, CSE1001: 85, CSE1002: 90
   ```

## How to Compile and Run 🚀

1. Save the code in a file named `StudentRecordManagement.cpp`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ StudentRecordManagement.cpp -o StudentRecordManagement
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./StudentRecordManagement
   ```
